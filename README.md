# Zoom Attendance Manager

Zoom Attendance Manager is a simple 100% browser Javascript application to help manage Zoom attendance reports.  The main benefit is to collect and manage multiple attendance reports downloaded from the Zoom.  Attendance reports can be downloaded from the Zoom web page (not the Zoom Workplace) in CSV format.

This application uses the localstorage feature of the web browser (only tested with Firefox and Chrome) to store data locally across sessions.
