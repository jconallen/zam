# Zoom Attendance Manager

Zoom Attendance Manager is a simple 100% browser JavaScript application to help manage Zoom attendance reports.  The main benefit is to collect and manage multiple attendance reports downloaded from Zoom.  Attendance reports can be downloaded from the Zoom web page (not the Zoom Workplace) in CSV format.

This application uses the Indexed DB feature of the web browser (only tested with Firefox and Chrome) to store data locally across sessions.  

You can preview this client-side application here: [https://jconallen.github.io/zam/](https://jconallen.github.io/zam/).

I've also added some [anonymized test data](https://github.com/jconallen/zam/tree/main/test_data) if you don't have any suitable data of your own to use yet.
